% This tutorial renders a retinal image of the chess set to illustrate
%
%    * Rendering with a pinhole, no lens.  Infinite depth of field
%    * Set the physiological optics and a focal distance on the rook.
%    * For a big pupil, the nearby pieces are very blurred
%    * Reduce the pupil diameter and the nearby pieces are less blurred.
%
% For speed, we do this calculation without chromatic aberration.
