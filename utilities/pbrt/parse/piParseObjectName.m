function [name, sz] = piParseObjectName(txt)
% Parse an ObjectName string in 'txt' to extract the object name and size.
%
% Cinema4D produces a line with #ObjectName in it. The format of the
% #ObjectName line appears to be something like this:
%
%   #ObjectName Plane:Vector(5000, 0, 5000)
%
% The only cases we have seen are NAME:Vector(X,Z,Y).  Someone seems to
% know the meaning of these three values which are read into 'res' below.
% The length is 2*X, width is 2*Y and height is 2*Z.
%
% Perhaps these numbers should always be treated as in meters or maybe
% centimeters?  We need to figure this out.  For the slantedBar scene we
% had the example above, and we think the scene might be about 100 meters,
% so this would make sense.
%
% We do not have a routine to fill in these values for non-Cinema4D
% objects.


% Find the location of one of these strings, such as #ObjectName
patternList = {'#ObjectName','#object name','#CollectionName',...
    '#Instance MeshName','#MeshName','#Instance CollectionName','#Instance Parent'};

    if isempty(loc)
        continue;

% pos = strfind(txt,':');

    sz.l = [];
    sz.w = [];
    sz.h = [];

    name = txt(loc(1)+length(pattern) + 1:loc_dimenstion-1);

    posA = strfind(txt,'[');

    sz.pmin = [-res(1)/2 -res(3)/2];
    sz.pmax = [res(1)/2 res(3)/2];

    % We are not really sure what these coordinates represent with respect to
    % the scene or the camera direction.  For one case we analyzed (a plane)
    % this is what the values meant.

%
% If we only have the identifier, then treat name as empty.
