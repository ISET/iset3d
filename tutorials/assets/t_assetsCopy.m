%% t_assetCopy
%
%  Make copies of an object in a recipe at different positions.
%
%  The original recipe is transformed by adding an 'instance' node of
%  each of the objects.  The instance is additional branch nodes with
%  the syntax 
%
%     id_originalName_B_I_1
%
%  The nodes are all modified to include
%      isObjectInstance,
%      referenceObject
%      instanceCount
%
% The original object with the data has
%      isObjectInstance 1
%      referenceObject is empty
%      instanceCount 1
%
%  The duplicate duplicate branch nodes have names like
%
%     id_originalName_B_I_N
%
% And the slots are
%
%      isObjectInstance 0
%      referenceObject string to the reference object
%      instanceCount [1 ... N]
%      
%
%
%
%  where id is the node id, originalName matches the original object.
