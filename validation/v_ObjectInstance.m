% lot of parts, though.

% created.  Right now they are used as a reference object.  I think the
% objects have the slot isObjectInstance set to 0. Also, we are using the
% string '_I_' in the node name to indicate an instance.

% The object is called taxi, but it does not show up in the object list.
% Here we add an instance of the taxi object, which references all of the
% subparts.  We may not be handling this correctly in parseGeometryText
% because we end up with duplicates in the asset tree.
