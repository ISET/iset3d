            % .json (if the pytorch code uses it, we can switch).

            % Then save the overall metadata (including recipe) to a mongoDB item with
            % that same ID. Need to figure out what/which indices we have.

            % If we also save the metadata to a .json in the metadata folder, then it
            % will be easier to re-create the mongoDB. In fact as a first pass we might
            % want to write out all the files and then bulk import them into a db.
