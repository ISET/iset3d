function [newlines] = piFormatConvert(txtLines)
% Format txtlines so that ISET3d parser (Zheng) can interpret it
%
% Brief Description
%  PBRT accepts free-style formats for the PBRT commands where the
%  parameters can be spread across several lines. ISET3d wants the key
%  words to be followed by all the parameters in a single line. 
%  
% Inputs
%   txtLines - A cell array of text lines read from a pbrt file.
%              These lines are from the geometry PBRT file.
%
% Output
%   newlines - Formatted to be compliant with ISET3d needs. 
%
% Description
%  This routine formats the free-style PBRT text files  so that the
%  key words are followed by their parameters in a single line.  Key
%  words include NamedMaterial, Shape, ConcatTransform, Transform,
%  MakeNamedMateria, Scale, Texture, LightSource (maybe others).
%
% It also catches various special cases.  For example,
%
%   1. Delete any empty lines
%   2. Remove comments (lines starting with #) unless it contains a
%      key string (parseString), such as #ObjectName
%   3. We delete lines with 'Warning'
%

%   Called by piRead -> piReadWorldText -> piFormatConvert and also
%   called by piRead -> piFormatConvert for the 'World' cell array

%% Initialize counters

%% remove empty cells

%% remove lines start with '#' but we keep lines with these strings

% We keep the text lines that do NOT start with # or that do contain
% one of the parseStrings.
parseStrings = {'#ObjectName','#object name','#CollectionName','#Instance','#MeshName'};
txtLines = txtLines(or(~strncmp(txtLines,'#',1), contains(txtLines,parseStrings)));

% We use these tokens to decide whether this is a line we process.  I
% am not sure how this list was generated.  Perhaps we should
% literally list the terms that we are looking for? (BW)
tokenlist = {'A', 'C' , 'F', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'R', 'S', 'T'};

% We replace tabs with a blank in all lines.
txtLines = regexprep(txtLines, '\t', ' ');

%% Put the block on a single line for the parser

% If the text has a right bracket, ], we are at the end of the block.
% We concatenate all the lines prior to this until we come to a stop.
% That way the block is on a single line for Zheng's parser.

%{
% These are the lines with a right bracket.  We will merge them with
% the prior line.  Maybe we should call this routine something like
% 'put block into single line'.   BW and DJC ran a lot of examples and
% it never went in here.  So we commented it out (03-22-2023)

    % Then we set this line to empty.  Empty lines will be removed shortly.
